# Kit.Api
## Kit.Api is an E-BookShop & Social Media Api that you can simulate shopping or borrowing books with sharing your activity with other people!

*Made this project because thought I need a debut project soo.. here it is.*
*I'm not a FE Dev. So I imagined that I'm working in a team as a backend. And this is what I would've done in such position.*

I hope you like it!

**The project includes following features:**
- Account management
- Traditional Book Shop features (Cart, Shopping)
- Borrowing books (or PDF's idk man it's just a simulator.)
- Commenting on books
- Book suggestion system based on your liking and recent books you read & purchased.
- Profile page that you can create posts and quotes from books.
- Displaying what book you are currently reading.
- A digital shelf that you can save books you already read.
- A discovery page that you can interact with other people's posts. (Like, comment, share on your profile.)
- Message chat. (Not like WhatsApp obviously.)
